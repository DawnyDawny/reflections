1 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It is a repository with untracked files. You need to add files to track to it.

2 - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I imagine it like a holding area that allows you to group together your commits and check them before the final commit.

3 - How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can check the differences between files here and only commit related changes.

4 - What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Trying out new features. Making experimental changes that may break the code.
Different people to work on different features?

5 - How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Graph diagrams help to show the various paths and also highlight where the master path and the current head is. 
Makes it easier to understand how orhaned branches could come about.
