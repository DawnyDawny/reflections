1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to collaborate with others on a project.
When you want to work on a project from more than one location or computer.
When you want to keep an online backup?

2 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If others have been collaborating on a project, you may not always want to take their changes straight away, especially if you have been working on the
same areas. You may have tried something out from another machine but decide you don't actually want it.
Automatic pulls may result in you overwirting files that you didn't mean to.
